Step 1: Set Up the Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Create a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or Spring Initializr.
2. Set up the necessary dependencies, such as Spring Web, to build a REST API.
3. Create a new Java class called `EmiRequest` to represent the data sent from the frontend.
4. Create a controller class to handle the API requests for the EMI calculation.

Step 2: Set Up the Frontend (Angular)

1. Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI: `ng new emi-calculator-app`
2. Set up the necessary forms module in the app module (app.module.ts).
3. Create a new model class called `EmiRequest` to represent the data sent from the frontend.
4. Create a new component called `EmiCalculatorComponent`.
5. Implement the EMI calculator form in the EmiCalculatorComponent template (emi-calculator.component.html).
6. Implement the EMI calculator logic in the EmiCalculatorComponent class (emi-calculator.component.ts).
7. Add some basic styles to the EmiCalculatorComponent (emi-calculator.component.css).

Step 3: Use a Service to Handle HTTP Calls

1. Create a new service called `EmiCalculatorService` to handle HTTP requests (emi-calculator.service.ts).
2. Update the EmiCalculatorComponent to use the `EmiCalculatorService` (emi-calculator.component.ts).
3. Ensure that `EmiCalculatorService` is added to the providers array in the app.module.ts (app.module.ts).

`form-control` and `form-group` are CSS classes commonly used in Bootstrap to style and structure HTML forms. Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides a set of pre-designed CSS classes and JavaScript components to create responsive and visually appealing web applications. Let's see how `form-control` and `form-group` can be used:

1. `form-control`:
   - `form-control` is a Bootstrap CSS class that is applied to form elements (such as input fields, text areas, and select dropdowns) to style them consistently.
   - When you apply the `form-control` class to an input element, it adds padding, border, and other styles to create a clean and consistent look for the form fields.

Example:
```html
<!-- Input field with the form-control class -->
<input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter your name">
```

2. `form-group`:
   - `form-group` is another Bootstrap CSS class that is used to group related form elements together.
   - It provides a visual grouping and improves the form's structure and appearance.
   - The `form-group` class is usually used with a `<label>` element to create a label for the form control.

Example:
```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" class="form-control" id="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
</div>
```

In the example above, the `form-group` class is applied to a `<div>` element that wraps both the `<label>` and `<input>` elements. This creates a visually grouped form control with a label.

Bootstrap provides many other utility classes and components that you can use to build complex forms and improve the overall user experience. It's worth exploring the Bootstrap documentation to discover the various form-related classes and components available for your projects.

It's important to note that Bootstrap is not mandatory to build forms in HTML. While it provides a convenient set of styles and components, you can create forms using your custom CSS or other CSS frameworks if you prefer. The decision to use Bootstrap or any other framework depends on the specific requirements and design preferences of your project.

`class="input-group mb-3"` is a set of Bootstrap CSS classes applied to an HTML element to create a styled input group. The `input-group` class is a fundamental Bootstrap class used to style and structure elements that are part of a cohesive group, such as input fields and buttons. The `mb-3` class is an additional Bootstrap spacing class that adds margin at the bottom to create vertical spacing between the input group and other elements.

Here's what each part of the class does:

1. `input-group`:
   - The `input-group` class is used to group elements that belong together in an input group, such as an input field with an associated button or text.

2. `mb-3`:
   - The `mb-3` class is one of Bootstrap's spacing utility classes used for margin. In this case, `mb` stands for "margin-bottom," and the `3` indicates the amount of margin applied. The value `3` corresponds to a medium-sized margin. You can use different values (e.g., `mb-1`, `mb-2`, `mb-4`, etc.) to adjust the spacing according to your design needs.

Example:
```html
<div class="input-group mb-3">
  <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Username" aria-label="Username" aria-describedby="basic-addon1">
  <div class="input-group-append">
    <span class="input-group-text" id="basic-addon1">@example.com</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

In the example above, the `input-group` class is applied to a `<div>` element, which contains an input field and a span element. The `mb-3` class adds some margin at the bottom of the input group.

Bootstrap's CSS classes help create consistent and visually appealing layouts quickly. By using `input-group` and other utility classes like `mb-3`, you can improve the presentation and user experience of your forms and other UI components without writing custom CSS styles from scratch.
